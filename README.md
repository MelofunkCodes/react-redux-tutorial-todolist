# React-Redux Tutorial: To Do List

To see the veryyyy simple demo: https://melofunkcodes.github.io/react-redux-tutorial-todolist/
 
Learning how to use Redux with React by implementing a simple To Do List that allows me to do 3 things:
1. Add tasks
2. Toggle them completed or not 
3. Choose to show either ALL, Completed, or Incompleted tasks using a filter 


Followed the tutorial from egghead.io's 
[Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

For reference, the partially transcribed notes of each of the 30 part videos can be found in
taiyorbeii's [egghead.io_redux_course_notes](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes).

And the original complete source code from the tutorial can be found [here](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html).


## To Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing
The testing of the todos reducer from [video 11](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/07-Writing_a_Todo_List_Reducer.md) was added to `App.test.js`. Just run `npm test` in your terminal to run the tests locally.
